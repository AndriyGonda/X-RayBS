## Program Description
X-ray Fluorescence Background Substractor uses for X-ray fluorescence spectra analysis.
The program performs the following functions:
- Description of the background line of the spectra of X-ray fluorescence;
- Subtraction of the background from the spectrum of X-ray fluorescence with the possibility
manual adjustment;
- Smoothing of experimental spectra by averaging and Savitsky-Goley filter;
- Comparative analysis of X-ray fluorescence spectra;
- Chemical elements analysis of X-ray fluorescence spectra;
- Quantitative analysis of the contents of the elements according to the standard samples;
- Ability to import third-party standart samples created by special a template.
---
The program is an third-party add-on to ElvaX 2.4 (https://elvatech.com).
The database of the spectral series of elements is formed using the open Bruker table (https://www.bruker.com).
The program supports the following operating systems: Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8 / 8.1, Windows 10, and Linux operating systems.
For build the program for Linux, please contact the author of the program at: andriy.gonda@gmail.com.
